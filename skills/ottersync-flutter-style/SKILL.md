# Ottersync Flutter Style

Use this skill when working on `/Users/themaoqiu/CodeRepo/Android/ottersync` and the goal is to keep the code aligned with the style established by the sibling reference project at `/Users/themaoqiu/CodeRepo/Android/test/test_project/lib`.

Read [references/test_project_style.md](references/test_project_style.md) before making structural changes, creating new pages, or introducing routing.
Read [references/DESIGN.md](references/DESIGN.md) before creating or modifying any UI. This is mandatory for page visuals, component visuals, theme tokens, spacing, color, typography, buttons, cards, pills, navigation, and dark/light theme decisions.

## First read

Inspect these files first because they define the current app shell:

- `lib/main.dart`
- `lib/routes/index.dart`
- `lib/pages/Main/index.dart`
- `skills/ottersync-flutter-style/references/DESIGN.md` for any UI-facing work

If the task is feature-specific, then inspect only the matching page folder and any directly related components.

## Folder rules

Keep the lib directory organized by responsibility, not by technical layer depth:

- `lib/pages/`: top-level screens and tab pages
- `lib/components/`: reusable or page-scoped UI blocks
- `lib/routes/`: app entry wiring and route registration
- `lib/viewmodels/`: lightweight data classes or view models when needed

Follow the reference project's naming pattern:

- A page lives at `lib/pages/<Feature>/index.dart`
- A component group lives at `lib/components/<Feature>/...`
- Directory names are PascalCase
- In this repo, component file names under `lib/components/` should stay PascalCase when they represent named UI blocks, for example `HeroSection.dart`, `SectionHeader.dart`, `TrendChartCard.dart`
- Prefer component names that read like frontend UI building blocks rather than domain records, for example `HeroSection`, `SummaryPanel`, `ChatBubble`, `SettingsOptionTile`
- It is acceptable for `pages/` to keep `index.dart`, while `components/` use explicit PascalCase file names

Do not introduce deep feature nesting unless the current task clearly needs it. This style is intentionally shallow and easy to scan.

## Coding style

Preserve the surrounding file's tone instead of aggressively normalizing it.

Default preferences:

- Use `package:` imports, not relative imports
- Keep widget trees inline and readable
- Prefer small private helper methods such as `_getChildren()` or `_buildSections()` when a widget list gets long
- Use private helper classes for local UI metadata, such as `_TabItem`
- Keep route builders and page containers simple; do not hide basic navigation structure behind extra abstraction
- Use Chinese copy if the surrounding UI already uses Chinese labels
- Prefer UI-oriented component names such as `Header`, `Section`, `Card`, `Panel`, `Tile`, `Item`, `Bar`, `Banner`
- Avoid underscored component file names in `lib/components/` unless the local folder already clearly uses another convention

Widget conventions from the reference project:

- Pages are usually `StatefulWidget`
- Extracted UI blocks are often widgets of their own instead of private build methods
- State classes and private helpers use leading underscores
- Naming usually ends with `Page` for full pages and `View` for tab content

Do not "upgrade" older files just for style cleanup. Match the local area you are editing. If the current ottersync file already uses a slightly more polished Material 3 style, keep that level of finish while preserving the same folder split and page organization.

## UI design rules

For any UI work, `skills/ottersync-flutter-style/references/DESIGN.md` is the source of truth.

- Always read `skills/ottersync-flutter-style/references/DESIGN.md` before changing page layout, colors, typography, cards, buttons, inputs, chips, navigation, or theme tokens
- Prefer reusing or extending shared theme tokens instead of hardcoding one-off colors, spacing, radii, or text styles
- Default to implementing UI through the project theme and shared design tokens first, then page/component code second
- Keep new visuals consistent with the design direction in `skills/ottersync-flutter-style/references/DESIGN.md`, especially dark-first surfaces, restrained accent usage, subtle borders, and typographic hierarchy
- If an existing screen conflicts with `skills/ottersync-flutter-style/references/DESIGN.md`, move the edited area toward that document instead of copying the older local style
- Do not introduce a new visual style direction unless the user explicitly asks to diverge from `skills/ottersync-flutter-style/references/DESIGN.md`
- When adding light mode support, derive it from the same token system and keep component roles consistent across themes

## Naming guidance

When creating or renaming reusable UI blocks in `lib/components/`:

- Favor PascalCase file names and exported widget class names
- Prefer names that describe what the user sees on screen, such as `HomeHeroSection`, `ProjectOverviewCard`, `WorkspaceOverviewBanner`
- Use suffixes intentionally:
  - `Section` for large content bands
  - `Header` for section headings or top summaries
  - `Card` for surfaced content blocks
  - `Panel` for denser grouped information
  - `Tile` or `Item` for list rows
  - `Bar` for compact interactive strips such as search/input/create areas
- Avoid vague names like `Widget1`, `Block`, `Part`, or overly backend-flavored names for pure UI components

## Routing guidance

The reference project centralizes routing in `lib/routes/index.dart` and exposes a single `getRootWidget()` entry used by `main.dart`.

If the task adds or refactors routing:

- Keep the root app wiring in `lib/routes/index.dart`
- Continue exposing a single `getRootWidget()` function from that file
- Register top-level routes in one place
- Keep page imports explicit and direct

If `go_router` is introduced or expanded:

- Define the router instance at file scope in `lib/routes/index.dart`
- Prefer named routes for top-level pages
- Keep each `GoRoute` builder simple and side-effect free
- Use `MaterialApp.router` from `getRootWidget()`
- Do not spread route registration across multiple files unless the route count becomes large enough to justify it

## When adding new UI

Use this sequence:

1. Decide whether the new code is a page, a page-scoped component, or a simple local widget fragment.
2. Place pages under `lib/pages/<Feature>/index.dart`.
3. If a page starts accumulating repeated sections, move those sections into `lib/components/<Feature>/`.
4. Add lightweight data classes under `lib/viewmodels/` only when the page starts passing structured data around.

## Scope discipline

This style favors momentum over over-engineering.

- Start with a direct implementation
- Extract only the pieces that are visibly reused or make the page easier to read
- Keep business logic light at this stage
- Leave room for later expansion instead of designing for every future case upfront
